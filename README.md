# Pride

## Description
Pride is a combat simulator implemented using [JADE](http://jade.tilab.com/). This project is the final work of the discipline of Programming Paradigms, offered by the University of Brasilia for Software Engineering students.

## How to run
  1. Import as "Existing Maven Project"  
  2. Run the "pom.xml" as "Maven clean"  
  3. Select one of existing simulators or create your own  
  4. Run the simulator as "Java Application"  
  Obs:. Use the .jar files in "/lib" only if Maven isn't working for you  

## The 10+ Commandments (For a good development)
  1. Before starting coding, read those rules to avoid problems  
  2. Verify your .gitignore to exclude inconvenient files  
  3. Always pull before starting coding and before pushing any code  
  4. Always commit working and well tested code  
  5. Always commit with an expressive message attached
      (Eg:. Readme updated! Rules section added!)  
  6. Always write code and comments in English (i18n comes later)  
  7. Refactor always as possible  
  8. Don't delete someone else's code, comment instead  
  9. Report your changes in this document  
  10. Add more rules if you consider that are something important missing
